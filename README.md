# ArduinoSudoku
Two implementations of a Sudoku solver to run on ARM Arduinos. Tested on an Arduino Due with the WiFi version intended to run on a MKR WiFi 1010.

The SudokuSmall version runs on an Arduino Mega 2560. Will load on a Uno but only the two first puzzles (rated easy and medium) will run. Hard puzzles run out of memory.
